# Register to vote
Select a jurisdiction you're a voter of (see [groups](groups)).

Select any of the elections scheduled in your jurisdiction, and
after deciding if you'd like to participate, select "Register to vote".

# Casting a vote
For a public vote, rank your choices, then click submit.

If you would not like your true vote to be publicly certified,
select "vote differently than polled", and a second ballot will be displayed.

# Checking a vote
When casting your vote, you have the ability to end-to-end verify the public polls,
and that your private ballot was counted as cast. To do so, view your voting record
under your profile, if it says "ready to audit" you may select to audit your vote.
